Diabetes is a prevalent disease across the globe, and its incidence is increasing each year. While the exact cause of diabetes is still unknown, scientists speculate that both genetic factors and lifestyle choices contribute significantly to the development of the disease.

Some years back, researchers conducted a study on the Pima tribe, also known as the Pima Indians, in which they discovered that the women in this tribe were highly susceptible to developing diabetes at an early age. To ensure accuracy, the study's criteria limited the selection of participants to females of Pima Indian heritage who were at least 21 years old.

We are conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis to examine various facets of diabetes in the Pima tribe.
